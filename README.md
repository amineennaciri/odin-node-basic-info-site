# odin-node-basic-info-site
This is the basic informational site project from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about creating a very basic informational site that contains 4 pages: indes, about, contact-me and 404. The purpose is to practice Node.js principles.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in using Node.js

Self-reflection and conclusion: this was an opportunity to practice creating a server from scratch hosted on my machine using Node.js
